      <h1>Midwest United States Dispatches</h1>
      <h2>Welcome, sticker recipient. You've basically won the emotionally cartographed lottery in the Midwest.</h2>

      <p>
        Each sticker is a quiet act of encouragement, mapped to the locales from my old stomping grounds. You may know me
        and you might not. It all depends on where you had your medications filled. Nowadays? I can be found roaming around
        The Emerald City, off in my own fantastical world, attuned to the routines a person with schizophrenia knows how
        best to follow. I've expanded the mission for just-a-human to include regions anywhere from the West Coast to
        the East Coast with an emphasis on randomizing recipients per Google Maps. This is emotional cartography at
        its finest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love it if you displayed your sticker in the bottom corner of your vehicle window, or somewhere visible to the general public,
        so others can benefit from the ripple effect I'm hoping to provide. Also, on the page here below, there's a comment section. Feel free to leave an anonymous one,
        or proudly display who's leaving kindness in return. Every act of kindness matters, and we're all appreciative of being seen, heard, and felt. <i>Keep comments
        appropriate, of course.</i>

      <h2>This song mentioned in your dispatch letter? Rooted in the heartland of America!</h2>
      <p>
        This song resonates with me in a way much like flannel wraps around my neck from a shawl.
        It's really about the simple pleasures and appreciating each blessing we're given, 
        never taken for granted, but always counted on for that much desired "pick me up."
