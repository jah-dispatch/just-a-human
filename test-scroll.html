      <h1>San Juan Area Dispatches</h1>
      <h2>Welcome, sticker recipient. You've basically won the emotionally cartographed lottery in the San Juan Area of Colorado.</h2>
      <p>
        Each sticker is a quiet act of encouragement, mapped to the locales around the San Juan Mountains in all their splendor, but with dignity and intention.
        I set out on a mission to deploy stickers that emotionally resonate with the ethos of who I am as a person, sharing my secret lore with the world around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love it if you displayed your sticker in the bottom corner of your vehicle window, or somewhere visible to the general public,
        so others can benefit from the ripple effect I'm hoping to provide. Also, on the page here below, there's a comment section. Feel free to leave an anonymous one,
        or proudly display who's leaving kindness in return. Every act of kindness matters, and we're all appreciative of being seen, heard, and felt. <i>Keep comments
        appropriate, of course.</i>
      </p>

      <h2>This song mentioned in your dispatch letter? Grammy-worthy gold.</h2>
      <p>
        This song resonates with me, because I'm the fragile, nonbinary soul who exists but often unseen, heard, and felt.
        It's the perfect song to resonate with those of you on the San Juan front as it echoes the altitude through
        bluegrass melancholy, with the ache each of you might sometimes feel. 
        And the quiet strength of somebody who might be broken, yet flies above anyway.
      </p>
