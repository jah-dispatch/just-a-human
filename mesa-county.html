  <h1>Mesa County Dispatches</h1>
  <h2>Welcome, sticker recipient. You've basically won the emotionally cartographed lottery in Mesa County, Colorado.</h2>

  <p>
    Each sticker is a quiet act of encouragement, mapped to the Western Slope with dignity and intention.
    I set out on a mission to deploy stickers that emotionally resonate with the ethos of Grand Junction and surrounding areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, you may know me, "The Wizard" yet not fully realize it. I'm <i>that person</i> who waves at you from the sidewalk,
    usually dressed flagrantly and unapologetically authentically because I am the "unicorn tiger" of Mesa County.
    Nonbinary by choice, friendly and compassionate by nature. And if you've been around the Grand Valley long enough—
    well then heck, my mother probably prepared your taxes back in "the day."
  </p>
  <p>I'd love it if you displayed your sticker in the bottom corner of your vehicle window, or somewhere visible to the general public,
    so others can benefit from the ripple effect I'm hoping to provide. Also, on the page here below, there's a comment section. Feel free to leave an anonymous one,
    or proudly display who's leaving kindness in return. Every act of kindness matters, and we're all appreciative of being seen, heard, and felt. <i>Keep comments
    appropriate, of course.</i></p>

      <h2>This song mentioned in your dispatch letter? Grammy-worthy gold.</h2>
      <p>
        This song resonates with me, because I'm the misunderstood type amongst Grand Junction.
        Often overlooked, but emotionally present and ready to know you.
        And I really do stand for the strange and lonely, because <i>I AM</i> the "strange and lonely," if you actually knew.
